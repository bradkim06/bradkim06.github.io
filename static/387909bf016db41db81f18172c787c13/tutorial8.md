Audit with Lighthouse
---
Quoting from the [Lighthouse website](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/):

### ✋ Create a production build
1. Stop the development server (if it’s still running) and run the following command:
`gatsby build`
2. View the production site locally. Run:
`gatsby serve`

Once this starts, you can view your site at `http://localhost:9000`.

### Run a Lighthouse audit
